# Description (260 characters)
SPL-8004 is infrastructure for building AI agents with on-chain identity, 
autonomous payments, and gasless transactions. Start free, scale as you grow.

# First Comment (Maker Introduction)
👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm [Name], builder of SPL-8004. We're solving a huge problem in the AI agent 
space: how do autonomous agents pay for services without human intervention?

Today, agents need:
❌ Manual wallet approvals (kills automation)
❌ Complex gas management (expensive & hard)
❌ Custom payment integration (months of work)
❌ No reputation system (trust issues)

SPL-8004 fixes this:
✅ Fully autonomous payments
✅ Zero gas fees (via Kora)
✅ Built-in SDK (5 min setup)
✅ On-chain reputation

We're launching with:
🎁 Free tier (100 requests/month)
📚 Complete documentation
🤖 Working examples (validation bots, trading bots)
⚡ Live on Solana Devnet

Try it now: npm install @spl-8004/sdk

Would love your feedback! Ask me anything 👇

### Twitter Launch Thread

```
🚀 We're launching SPL-8004 on Product Hunt TODAY!

Build autonomous AI agents on Solana in 5 minutes.

What makes it special? 🧵

1/ The Problem
AI agents today can't pay for services autonomously.
Manual wallet approvals kill automation.
Gas fees drain agent wallets.
No reputation system = trust issues.

2/ The Solution
SPL-8004 is infrastructure for truly autonomous agents:
• On-chain identity ✓
• Gasless payments ✓  
• Auto-pay SDK ✓
• Reputation tracking ✓

3/ How it works
npm install @spl-8004/sdk

const agent = createAgent({...});
await agent.accessProtectedEndpoint('/api/premium');

That's it. Agent pays automatically. No pop-ups. No human intervention.

4/ Use Cases
🤖 Validation bots that submit work & get paid
📊 Data aggregators that buy premium feeds
💹 Trading bots that access paid signals
🔮 Oracle providers with pay-per-use

5/ What's Included
✓ Free tier (100 req/month)
✓ Complete SDK
✓ Gasless transactions (Kora)
✓ On-chain identity (Solana)
✓ Working examples

6/ We're Live on Solana Devnet
Real blockchain transactions.
Real payments.
Real agents working autonomously.

### Hacker News Post

```
Title: SPL-8004 – Build Autonomous AI Agents on Solana

Hey HN,

We built SPL-8004, infrastructure for AI agents that can pay for services 
autonomously without human intervention.

Problem: Today's agents need manual wallet approvals, gas fee management, 
and custom payment integrations. This kills the "autonomous" part.

Solution: We created:
- SDK with auto-pay logic (detects 402, pays, retries)
- Gasless transactions via Kora Network
- On-chain identity & reputation on Solana
- Free tier to get started

Example code:
  const agent = createAgent({ privateKey: "..." });
  const data = await agent.accessProtectedEndpoint("/api/premium");
  // Agent automatically pays if endpoint requires payment

Live on Devnet with real blockchain transactions.

Demo: https://spl8004.io/demo
SDK: npm install @spl-8004/sdk
Docs: https://docs.spl8004.io

Would love HN's feedback, especially on:
1. Security model (agents holding crypto)
2. Pricing structure ($0-$499/month tiers)
3. SDK API design

Ask me anything!
```

Title: [Project] SPL-8004 - Infrastructure for Autonomous AI Agents

Hey r/solana! 

Launching SPL-8004 today - infrastructure for building AI agents on Solana.

**What it does:**
Agents can make payments autonomously without manual wallet approvals. 
Built with on-chain identity, reputation system, and gasless transactions.

**Tech stack:**
- Solana (Devnet)
- Kora Network (gasless txns)
- Anchor framework
- TypeScript SDK

**Why it's cool:**
First time agents can truly operate autonomously on blockchain. No pop-ups, 
no manual approvals, zero SOL gas fees.

**Try it:**
npm install @spl-8004/sdk

Links:
- Demo: https://spl8004.io

**r/programming:**
```
Title: Built an SDK for autonomous AI agent payments on blockchain

Over the past few months, I built infrastructure for AI agents that need to 
pay for services without human intervention.

The problem: Agents can't approve wallet transactions automatically. This 
breaks the "autonomous" promise.

The solution: SDK that detects payment requirements (HTTP 402), makes payment, 
and retries request with proof. All automatic.

Tech:
- TypeScript SDK
- Solana blockchain (for identity)
- Gasless transactions (Kora)
- Zero manual approvals

Example:
  const agent = createAgent({ privateKey: key });
  const data = await agent.accessProtectedEndpoint(url);
  // If endpoint returns 402, agent pays and retries automatically

Open source, free tier available.

Docs: https://docs.spl8004.io
SDK: npm install @spl-8004/sdk

Feedback welcome!

## Crisis Management

### Potential Issues & Responses

**Issue: "Security concerns about agents holding private keys"**
```
Response: Great question! Security is our top priority:

1. Agents hold minimal funds (refill as needed)
2. Multi-sig available for enterprise  
3. Key rotation supported
4. Spending limits configurable
5. Activity monitoring built-in

More: https://docs.spl8004.io/security
```

**Issue: "Why not use traditional payment APIs?"**
```
Response: Traditional APIs require:
- Credit cards (PCI compliance, fraud)
- API keys (centralized, revocable)
- Bank accounts (slow settlement)

Crypto payments offer:
- Instant settlement
- No chargebacks
- Global by default
- Programmable money
- On-chain reputation
```

**Issue: "What if Solana goes down?"**
```
Response: We have:
- 99.99% uptime SLA (Enterprise)
- Fallback payment methods
- Automatic retries
- Multi-region deployment

Solana's recent upgrades have improved reliability significantly.
```

**Issue: "Too expensive"**
```
Response: Let's compare:

Traditional:
- PCI compliance: $10K-$50K/year
- Payment processor: 2.9% + $0.30
- International: 4%+
- Chargebacks: 1-2% loss

SPL-8004:
- 2.5% flat fee
- No setup costs
- No chargebacks
- Global by default

For most use cases, we're 50%+ cheaper.
